## Description

KostenrechnungVue is a tool for a specific company to calculate a cost accounting. The costs (Kosten) and incomes (Leistungen) can be added in the bottom and the result is displayed at the top.

There are the following costs (Kosten) and incomes (Leistungen):
- Wartungsvertr√§ge: fixed contracts which pay a fixed monthly amount.
- Extra Einnahmen: irregular incomes payed once.
- Personal: List of staff.
- Kalkulierte Kosten: Gemeinkosten, Serverkosten, Nebenkosten, Vertriebskosten have been calculated based on earlier years and are assumed to remain static.
